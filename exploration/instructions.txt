LIFE CYCLE: TODO -> WIP -> DONE -> TESTING -> FINISHED


1. Train Lab Rat model - try various existing text to image approaches

    # Data Preparation
    -> Tag-line generation
        -> Write Tagline Generation Script | DONE 
        -> Manual Taglines -> (man that gotta be lot of manual work) 
            -> DIY | TODO
            -> Get lob help | TODO (optional)
        -> Image Captioning Model
            -> Find image to text model that is very factual and detailed | DONE (M^2)
            -> how to download and use M^2? | WIP
                -> down load annotaions and import | FINISHED
                -> download features and import | FINISHED
                -> download model and import | FINISHED
                -> Setup env wif conda | WIP
                -> Test runs and get it prepped | TODO
            -> Integrate wif script | TODO
        

    -> Image sizing
        -> Resize Images | FINISHED
        -> Write padding function  | FINISHED
    

    # Training Framework
    -> Pick candidate models | FINISHED
        -> DreamBooth: https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/tree/main/examples/dreambooth
    -> Make sure we can use DreamBooth!!! | WIP
        -> Torch has torch.mps but accelerate won't recognize when run on command line, plz fix | WIP
            -> Could be shell script path variable issue or env variable issue?
              
    -> Build Training framework | TODO
    -> Install and Read Tutorials + figure out how to train each -> write template | TODO
    -> Save resized and padded images of appropriate sizes per model type to be tried | TODO

    # Training
    
    -> Test for robustness: Prob just could eyeball it (half a day just tweaking shit)
    -> Maybe even get underground lobs to describe some of the images in their own way (who knows how long - let's try try when they do it)

2. Train poisoning model - VAE, GAN, DIFFUSION
    -> Study about the effect of how poison will behave once resized or should it be poisoned once resized? 
        (realistically artists will poison it and then the model will resize it right?)
    -> Think about whether the model poisons and then resizes or we resize and then poison (with padding)
    -> Based on image size chosen, data availability, and padding/imputation method, determine the architecture

 -----
Lab Rat goal ->
1) Input Text and what not but eventually it needs to be able to output image much like that of seafood art 
    but support many textual styles
2) 





##### SOME NOTES on fundamental attributes of a neural net (in plain words)
1) Creativity of a Model: Vagueness of text/input -> how variant the image becomes depending on when (how much liberty it takes)
2) 



#### Notes on text to image model



### Wht am I building here
# 1) Lab Rat Model - save it so others can use it as well
# 2) Model that creates poison pill images (reverse engineering nightshade ya know)
# 3) Make sure that poison model stays fairly pvt unless it sorta works, 
    insted offer some endpoints or some kind of demo/usability channels for it



----- GOALS
4/17: FINISH GENERATING taglines + build training framework
4/18: Start Running training experiments + While experiments are running, start architecting poison model
4/19: Dependoing on experiment results, either keep iterating | OR | Start poisoning our model! -> need poisoned model nd unpoisoned model
4/20-4/21: Hackathon -> Either buidl foundational models and show a demo case or use the time to start working on some kind of provenance as experience layer
4/22: Check on progress onf model poisoning
