# HomemadeAIPoison
It's home-made.

## GOAL:
Let's take a crack at some home-made AI poison

## Problem:
Nightshade doesn't publicise their code but you can try out there software... On my mac with M1 Pro chip would only allow up to 3 pictures to be converted at a time at 1-5 mins of conversion per picture.

## Approach:
Welp it's basically trynna take a look at couple pictures converted by Nightshade using different strength levels, observing what's been done, and try to deduce what types of mathematical transformations might have been done to the data.

## Tools?
Good old-fashioned reverse engineering skills.

Some refereshers on how backpropagation and neural net activations work mathematically and functionally.

Off-the-shelf AI models as virtual lab rats...



## Disclaimer:
If this is successful, please do not use this for unethical or illegal purposes. I will find it out and make sure to report it to the authorities.

I want people to use this to defend against unethical and predatory uses of AI, not as an excuse to build malicious things. 

Welp tbh, you have some statistical guarantees that having some poisoned data won't completely ruin your AI model so there's that.
