# HomemadeAIPoison
It's home-made and hurts bad AI...

## What?
Prepare some lab rats... I mean AI models to poison...

## Problem:
Most AI poison pill tools don't publicize their code. Sure you can randomize your data or ad adversarial examples or whatever but what if you're just some person who don't really know how AI works?

## Approach:
Reverse Engineer some poison models

## Tools?
Good old-fashioned reverse engineering skills.

Some refereshers on how backpropagation and neural net activations work mathematically and functionally.

Off-the-shelf AI models as virtual lab rats...



## Disclaimer:
If this is successful, please do not use this for unethical or illegal purposes. I will find it out and make sure to report it to the authorities.

I want people to use this to defend against unethical and predatory uses of AI, not as an excuse to build malicious things. 

Welp tbh, you have some statistical guarantees that having some poisoned data won't completely ruin your AI model so there's that.
